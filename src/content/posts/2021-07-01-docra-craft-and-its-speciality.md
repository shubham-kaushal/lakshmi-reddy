In India, the antiquated scholarly work ‘Shilpshastra’ goes into the detail of metal working with alloys to create architectural and religious artworks and a wide variety  of utilities for  every day use. Dokra likewise is heavily inspired from religion and nature. Metal made icons were considered significant religious items which gained a prominent place for Dokra in the Hindu Society.  The ancient art of Lost wax technique was soon seen in temples donning the attire of power and purity.

Whether its, sculpting the figurine of their idol or creating more interactive items like animal figurines of elephants, horses, peacocks or intricate jewelry, Dokra craft acknowledges all aspects present in a human life. The craft specializes in intricacies. Detail after detail, the craft marries the form to be made. From the unnoticeable to the signature design, Dokra craft has captured perfectly the elements of proportion and  balance.  A wide range of motifs, some straight, some coil while some repeat itself to represent the self occurring forms and details present in nature.  Created using a single line of wax the forms that can be generated are limitless. The same is used to create divergence while the same is used to showcase the smallest of detail.  The organic features hug curvilinear forms or sometimes sit on top of such forms. The limitations of the craft are few, but the single thread of wax is not one of them, as it continues to meet at points or repeat at intervals.
