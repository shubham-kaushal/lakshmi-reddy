Long before the grounds for industrialization were laid, there were groups of men of nomadic background travelling from village to village creating masterpieces with the metal at hand. They not only  repaired broken pots but left behind something which grew to become one of the most prized pieces of historical evidence. An evidence which elevated the research and understanding of the people and their practices. Artefacts and evidences of such craftsmanship and detail for the era it dates back to was a pathbreaking testimonial in terms of Design and Art, which also celebrated intricate yet unique approach towards  their Art form and life in general. 

The famous Dancing girl Artefact found at Mohenjo-Daro in 1926 by Ernest Mackay is one such piece which speaks of nothing but high Craftsmanship. One can imagine the day it was made,  hands holding the wax form delicately to the same hands  preparing for the more laborious  side of the process. The necklace, the bangles, the detail to ornamentation reflects the perception of a woman and her body as conceptualized by the people of that historical period.

Lost wax technique or the French word ‘ cire perdue ‘ is a technique adopted to create all kinds of products. First seen thousands of years ago the methodology  involves a lot of patience and an eye to detail. It was more than 4,500 years ago when people of the Indus Valley Civilization were making such pieces of handcrafted perfection. The craft uses non-ferrous metal as the main raw material. The form and the decorative nature of the craft reeks stories of high visualization and desire and the confluence of aesthetic with design. Dokra craft  preaches on such grounds as it is all about the people  , the nature around and the innate manifestation of a higher power.
